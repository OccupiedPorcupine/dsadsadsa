// Approach B: Iterated Local Search, based on Vansteenwegen et al. (2009),
// "Iterated local search for the team orienteering problem with time windows".
//
// All politicians are planned together. Each round:
//   1. Insert:  keep adding the best (town, politician, position, timing) until nothing else fits.
//   2. Shake:   remove a few visits from every route, so the next round can try other choices.
// The best plan seen in any round is the answer.
//
// What makes insertion fast is maxShift. For every planned visit we store how much later it
// could start without causing trouble further along the route (running into another politician's
// rally, running past the end of the day's window, or getting home too late). Checking whether
// an insertion fits is then one comparison instead of re-simulating the rest of the route.
//
// Soft clash rule: each insertion is tried with two timings, "wait" (start once the town is free)
// and "clash" (start as soon as the window allows and overlap someone). Clashes are only ever
// created on purpose, at the visit being inserted: maxShift never lets a later visit drift into one.
